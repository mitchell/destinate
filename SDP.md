# 4.0 Software Development Plan


## 4.1   Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan (SDP) provides the details of the planned development for the travel application Destinate.
Destinate is an application that provides event suggestions and itinerary suggestions.

During our 16 week development process, our team will continuously keep in touch with each other via meetings and text message. Prototype versions of our app will be tested and developed on our offline machines until refined enough to have version updates on GitHub.

 In order to develop effectively and challenge ourselves, we will use cutting edge technologies that we were not previously familiar with such as: GO language, Serverless framework, AWS relational database service, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, Ionic Progressive WebApp Framework.
