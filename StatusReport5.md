# April 2018

This is the written report for the last month of the semester. We're pleased with the status of the backend but we wish we had more time for the FrontEnd. A lot of the project came together in this month, as the previous months we had many difficulties due to the fact that our original scope deemed too advanced to get completed within a single semester.

## Tasks Completed

* Partial Integration of FrontEnd and BackEnd
* Completed BackEnd
  * Points System
  * Like and Dislike List Storage
  * Password Authentication
  * Recommendation System
* Progress on FrontEnd
  * More UI Options added
  * Display Liked List
* context menu for actions
* node searcher
* expanded library


## Tasks to be done in next report

* This is the last report.

## Risks, Concerns and Problems
We wish we would have scoped our project initially because figuring out what could be done within the allotted time and readjusting accordingly was the biggest source of difficulty. In the future, we could improve by overestimating the amount of time everything takes and sticking to the schedule more tightly.

## Additional Comments

* It's been a great year!
